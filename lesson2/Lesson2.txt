MAPPING AND ADDRESS
MSG.SENDER
REQUIRE
INHERITANCE

mapping and address are solidity data types


---mapping---
mapping can be likened to a data type/data structure of key pair values. It can e likened to
dictionaries in python and json object in javascript.

example :
    // For a financial app, storing a uint that holds the user's account balance:
    mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;

    for the above map called accountBalance, the key will be an address while it's value will be a uint


    // Or could be used to store / lookup usernames based on userId
    mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;

    for the above map called userIdToName, it the key is a unit while it's value is a string


---address---

The Ethereum blockchain is made up of accounts which can be likened to banck accounts.
An account has an Ether balance which is the native currency used on the Ethereum blockchain.

Each account has an address on the blockchain. It serves as a unique identifier that points to that account.

An address can be owned by a USER or A CONTRACT

msg.sender is a global variable available to all functions. which refers to the address of the person
or Smart contract who called the current function


---require---

require makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true

example 


        pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

        contract OwnerBalance{

            address owner = msg.sender;
            uint balance = 0;

            function setBalance() public returns(uint) {
                return balance++;
            }

            function getBalance() public view returns(uint, address){

                // until balance has been incremented and made equal to 6, this function
                // will not run the code below the require statement which is to return balane and owner's address
                require(balance == 6);
                return (balance, owner);
            }

        }
