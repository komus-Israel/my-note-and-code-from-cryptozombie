MAPPING AND ADDRESS

mapping and address are solidity data types


---mapping---
mapping can be likened to a data type/data structure of key pair values. It can e likened to
dictionaries in python and json object in javascript.

example :
    // For a financial app, storing a uint that holds the user's account balance:
    mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;

    for the above map called accountBalance, the key will be an address while it's value will be a uint


    // Or could be used to store / lookup usernames based on userId
    mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;

    for the above map called userIdToName, it the key is a unit while it's value is a string


---address---

The Ethereum blockchain is made up of accounts which can be likened to banck accounts.
An account has an Ether balance which is the native currency used on the Ethereum blockchain.

Each account has an address on the blockchain. It serves as a unique identifier that points to that account.

An address can be owned by a USER or A CONTRACT

msg.sender is a global variable available to all functions. which refers to the address of the person
